# TODO 4.2 A condition controlled loop
print("=" * 10, "Section 4.2 condition controlled loop", "=" * 10)
# Write a while loop that will change the variable in num by subtracting 1,
# then print the variable. Keep looping until num = 0, ie. while num > 0:
num = 10
# write your code here, the variable needs to exist before you start the loop


# TODO 4.3 the For Loop
print("=" * 10, "Section 4.3 for loop", "=" * 10)
# Use a for-in loop with a list of the days of the week,
# print each day of the week
# SEE PROGRAM 4-6 FOR AN EXAMPLE


# TODO 4.3 using range() in a for loop
print("=" * 10, "Section 4.3 using range() in a for loop", "=" * 10)
# use the range function to print the numbers from 1 to 10


# TODO 4.3 using range() with a step value
print("=" * 10, "Section 4.3 using range() with a step value", "=" * 10)
# use the range function to print the odd numbers from 5 to 15


# TODO 4.3 using the control variable in a for loop
print("=" * 10, "Section 4.3 using the control variable in a for loop", "=" * 10)
# NOTE: The terms "Control Variable" and "Target Variable" both refer to the for loop variable
# 1) Write a for loop using range(1,10) and a control variable called number
# 2) Inside the loop, print the result of number times 7


# TODO 4.4 a running total
print("=" * 10, "Section 4.4 running total", "=" * 10)
# Use a loop to have the user enter 5 numbers, provide a total at the end
# You will need to initialize your accumulator before entering the loop
# You can assume valid integers are entered


# TODO 4.5 Sentinel Value
print("=" * 10, "Section 4.5 sentinel value", "=" * 10)
# Create a variable to store a total amount. Initialize it to zero.
# Initialize another variable to store a count of the numbers entered.
# Use a while loop to have the user enter test scores until
# a sentinel value of -1 is entered.
# After the loop, display the total, the count, and the average (total / count)


# TODO 4.6 validating data
print("=" * 10, "Section 4.6 data validation loop", "=" * 10)
# Ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 10.
# Use a while loop to force the user to repeat the
# input until the user enters a valid number. Test with
# both valid and invalid data.
